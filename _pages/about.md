**Research Summary**

My research addresses the question of inequality in everyday life. I investigate how families, gender and social class structure people’s daily activities such as paid work, housework, leisure, sleep and care. My work lies at the intersection of Family Sociology, Gender Sociology, Social Stratification and Time-Use Research. My work is not only concerned with inequalities within countries but also comparatively explores inequalities between countries and through time. I use a number of quantitative surveys in my work, such as time-use surveys and household panel surveys, combining a variety of statistical methods, such as sequence analysis, fixed-effects models, synthetic control methods, etc.
