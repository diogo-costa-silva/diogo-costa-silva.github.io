Hello, I'm Diogo and welcome to my personal website!
I'm a student finishing my master's thesis in Information Systems Engineering and Management who is looking to start his professional career in the area of ​​data analysis and science. 

I spent a year and a half on an academic scholarship, which allowed me to immerse myself in the world of data analysis and science.

Although I have not stepped into the corporate world yet, I bring with me a genuine passion for leading and an intrinsic motivation to improve team dynamics. I am dedicated to ongoing learning and committed to meeting and exceeding collective objectives.

In the technical domain, Python is my primary tool of trade, but I'm also familiar with the basic aspects of R and SQL. As I progress into the professional landscape, I am enthusiastic about applying and expanding these skills, and making meaningful contributions along the way.
