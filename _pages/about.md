**Research Summary**

My research addresses the question of inequality in everyday life. I investigate how families, gender and social class structure peopleâ€™s daily activities such as paid work, housework, leisure, sleep and care. My work lies at the intersection of Family Sociology, Gender Sociology, Social Stratification and Time-Use Research. My work is not only concerned with inequalities within countries but also comparatively explores inequalities between countries and through time. I use a number of quantitative surveys in my work, such as time-use surveys and household panel surveys, combining a variety of statistical methods, such as sequence analysis, fixed-effects models, synthetic control methods, etc.
