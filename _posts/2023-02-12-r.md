In this post, you will learn how to create `functions` in `R`. Functions can be useful for all kinds of things, like speeding up coding by wrapping different functions together.

--------------------------------

# Basics

The basic idea behind a **function** is to feed the function (i.e. action) with an **input**, and retrieve a **transformed output**

Consider the example below of a "car wrecker". The **"function"** is the car wrecking machine, the **input** is a car and the **output** is a cube. The function is the action of squeezing the car. On a very general level, the function could be written as something like this

{% highlight r linenos %}
 function(input=car)
 squeeze
 return(cube)
{% endhighlight %}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/cube.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

--------------------------------

# Functions in R

In `R`, to create a function, you simply need to use the command `function`. You need to save it with `=` or `<-`, giving it any name you like. Here I call the function `my_function`. 

Importantly, you need to give the function the name of your input, here I use `x`.

    my_function = function(x){
      print(x)
    }

    my_function(x = 10)

This is the same as

    random_function_name = function(abc){
      print(abc)
    }

    random_function_name(abc = 10)

This function simply prints your input. Let's now try a more complex action.

--------------------------------

Let's do a function to square numbers. Let's call this function `sq` (or `square_number` if you prefer).

\begin{equation}
\text{sq}(x) = x^2
\end{equation}

This looks like this 

    sq = function(x){
      y = x^2
      return(y)
    }

If you test it `sq(x=10)`, you get `100`. 

We can create a more general function with making the power *variable*. We call the power simply `power`, and we store the result into `y`

    power_function = function(x, power){
      y = x^power
      return(y)
    }

Again note that you can call `power` anything you want, `p`, `w`, whatever. The same applies to `y`, you can call it `output` or whatever you want.

This is the same, just with different names. 

    power_function = function(x, p){
      output = x^p
      return(output)
    }

# Functions as wrapper

One useful way to use functions is to wrap other functions (e.g. saving time).

Imagine you are often doing the following line of code

    round(prop.table(table(mtcars$gear, mtcars$carb), margin = 2), digits = 3)

You are doing a tabulation (`table`), then you are doing row/columns percentages (`prop.table`) on this table and finally you are rounding the numbers (`round`). We have 3 functions here, `table`, `prop.table` and `round`. 

Instead of repeating all the time this convoluted code, you can **wrap** it into a function.

Let's call this function `pt` (prop-table), with an input that is a table (`tab`). We make variable the `margin` parameter `prop.table` and the `digits` parameter of the function `round`. 

We can put some initial values in the function itself. Here I set the initial value of `margin`, which I call `mar` as 1 (meaning I want the row percentages) and the value of 3 for the digits, which I call `dig`. 

This looks like this

    pt = function(tab, mar = 1, dig = 3){
      out = round(prop.table(tab, margin = mar), digits = dig)
      return(out)
    }
    
Let's test our function `pt`

    pt(table(mtcars$gear, mtcars$carb), mar = 1, dig = 3
    
Changing the `dig` to 1 means rounding to 1 digit and mar to 2 means we are now taking the colum percentages
  
    pt(table(mtcars$gear, mtcars$carb), mar = 2, dig = 1)
    
We also input a table object

    tab = table(mtcars$gear, mtcars$carb)
    pt(tab, mar = 2, dig = 1)

# Functions with lapply

Functions can be useful for situations when you have to repeat codes, such as in a [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) framework.

Let's say that you want to simulate the following code many times. You create two random normal distributions (`x1` and `x2`) and then you take the squared differences (`(x1-x2)^2`).

    n=50
    x1 = rnorm(n)
    x2 = rnorm(n)
    (x1-x2)^2

One thing you can do to generate (re-run) this code many times is to wrap it into a function and then you use `lapply` to repeat it. This can also be computationally effective if you then use things like [parallel](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf) versions of `lapply`.

We create a function called `f_repeat` (again call it what you wish). The only input we give it is `i`, because we are going to use `lapply` to loop it.

    f_repeat = function(i){
      n=50
      x1 = rnorm(n)
      x2 = rnorm(n)
      output = (x1-x2)^2
      return(output)
    }


You can run the function empty and it will work 

    f_repeat

Now we can loop it or repeat with `lapply` like this (50 times)

    lapply(1:50, function(i) f_repeat(i))


Note that you can also use the function `replicate` and do the same thing

    replicate(50, expr = f_repeat(), simplify = F)

I personally prefer lapply because it is more flexible in complex setting but it will work fine here.

--------------------------------------------

# All the functions

{% highlight r %}
square_function = function(x){
  y = x^2
  return(y)
}

power_function = function(x, power){
  y = x^power
  return(y)
}

pt = function(tab, mar = 1, dig = 3){
  out = round(prop.table(tab, margin = mar), digits = dig)
  return(out)
}

f_repeat = function(i){
  n=50
  x1 = rnorm(n)
  x2 = rnorm(n)
  output = (x1-x2)^2
  return(output)
}

# testing the functions
square_function(x = 10)
power_function(x = 10, power = 3)
pt(table(mtcars$gear, mtcars$carb), mar = 2, dig = 1)
lapply(1:50, function(i) f_repeat(i))
replicate(50, expr = f_repeat(), simplify = F)
{% endhighlight %}
